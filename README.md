Address Information Service
---------------------------

Address Information Service (AIS) provides access to city data within the
specific domain of addresses.

AIS does not aim to be an open data platform; the City of Philadelphia uses
Open Data Philly as their general purpose data platform. Instead, AIS provides
address-specific services on top of that data so that it can better be used in
geographically-based applications. This scope includes:

- Address parsing and normalization
- Reconciling ranged addresses and units within buildings
- Geocoding addresses

Simple querying of well-known data, bulk downloads, etc. fall out of the scope
of AIS.
