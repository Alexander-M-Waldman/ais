# Address Information System (AIS)

AIS provides a unified view of City data for an address.

## Goals

- Simplify relationships between land records, real estate properties, streets, and addresses
- Provide a way of standardizing addresses citywide
- Support applications that require geocoding and address-based data lookups
- Provide a feedback mechanism for continually improving parity between department datasets
- Deprecate legacy systems for geocoding and address standardizing

## Components

- geocoder
- address standardizer (see [passyunk](https://github.com/cityofphiladelphia/passyunk))
- integration environment for address-centric data
